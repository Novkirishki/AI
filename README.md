## Task 1 - Frogs

## Task 2 - Sliding Blocks

## Task 3 - N Queens

## Task 4 - Knapsack problem
A program that solves the knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm. The initial population is created randomly. Each next population is created from 25% of the "best" individuals from the previous population. 25% of the individuals are created using selection, 25% using crossover and 50% using mutation. The algorithm prints the current best solution on every 50 iterations. 

## Task 5 - Tic Tac Toe
A game of Tic Tac Toe realized using the MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game can be played AI vs AI or AI vs Player.
It can also be played on a larger than 3x3 board. However on an empty larger board the AI takes a lot of time to make a move.
A game on a larger board can be tested by adding some random initial values to the board.
